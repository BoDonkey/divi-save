# divi-save
## This repo provides the changes needed to implement a save button on the admin bar for use with the Divi visual front-end builder.
### The repo consists of two main and one optional parts. The first main part is a function to be slotted into the WordPress functions.php file. This new function will insert the button into the admin bar and enqueue the neccessary javascript.
### The second main part is a javascript program that sets up click listeners and triggers to make the newly created button function.
### The final, and optional, part of this repo is a short bit of CSS that styles the newly added button.

### This repo is mainly being created to get feedback on the style of the javascript section of the repo. I'm self-taught and need to improve the efficiency and readability of my code. I welcome any feedback!
